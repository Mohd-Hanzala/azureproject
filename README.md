##  Key Components

### Azure Data Factory Pipeline

Azure Data Factory orchestrates the entire data workflow. Pipelines extract data from Azure SQL Server, validate the data, and load it into Azure Data Lake. ForEach activities handle multiple tables dynamically. The pipeline tracks execution metrics and handles errors gracefully.

### Databricks Notebooks

Notebooks contain PySpark code for data transformations. Bronze layer notebooks read raw SQL data and persist it with timestamps. Silver layer notebooks apply cleaning and validation logic. Gold layer notebooks create the Star Schema fact and dimension tables.

### Delta Live Tables

Delta Live Tables provide a declarative approach to building data pipelines. They automatically handle dependencies between tables and enable data quality monitoring. The gold pipeline creates streaming tables that feed dashboards and reports.



### Jinja2 Templates

Dynamic SQL query generation using Jinja2 templating. Configuration files define table mappings and transformation rules. Templates reduce code duplication and improve maintainability across multiple data sources.

### Logic Apps Integration

Azure Logic Apps sends notifications when pipelines complete. Email alerts notify teams of successful executions or failures. Integration with Azure Data Factory webhooks enables automated workflow notifications.

### Azure SQL Server Source

Azure SQL Server acts as the source system containing transactional data. Connection strings managed securely in Azure Key Vault. Firewall rules control access to the database.

##  Data Flow

**Source Extraction**
Data is extracted from Azure SQL Server using Azure Data Factory. Incremental loads use watermark columns to track changed data. Only new and modified records are processed in subsequent runs.

**Bronze Layer Landing**
Raw data lands in Azure Data Lake in the bronze folder. Current timestamp is added to identify when data was loaded. Original source structure is preserved without transformation.

**Silver Layer Transformation**
PySpark jobs read bronze layer data and apply transformations. Duplicate records are removed based on business keys. Data types are validated and null values are handled. Business rules are applied and data is enriched.

**Gold Layer Star Schema**
Fact and dimension tables are created from silver layer data. The Star Schema structure consists of central fact tables connected to dimension tables. Slowly changing dimensions track historical attribute changes. Data is optimized for analytical queries.



##  Data Models

### Star Schema Implementation

**Fact Tables**
Contain measures and metrics from business events. Store transactional data at the lowest level of granularity. Use foreign keys to connect to dimension tables.

**Dimension Tables**
Provide context and descriptive information for facts. Enable filtering, grouping, and sorting in analytical queries. Support slowly changing dimension logic for historical tracking.

**Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 2)**
Track changes in dimension attributes over time. Maintain effective dates and end dates for historical records. Enable period-over-period analysis and trend identification.



##  Project Outcomes

**Data Pipeline Automation**
Automated end-to-end data pipelines reduce manual effort and improve reliability. Scheduled execution ensures data freshness. Error handling and retry logic ensure robust operations.

**Incremental Processing**
Watermark-based incremental loads optimize performance and reduce costs. Only changed data is processed in each pipeline run. Historical tracking maintains data lineage.

**Dimensional Modeling**
Star Schema provides an intuitive structure for business analysis. Dimension tables enable rich context for fact analysis. Query performance is optimized through denormalization.

**Version Control Integration**
Git integration enables collaborative development and code review. CI/CD pipelines automate testing and deployment. Code changes are tracked and auditable.
